# G's Cleaning Welcome Email Variants

Context: Someone signed up for "Product Updates" on gscleaningnyc.com

---

## Variant 1: Pure Confirmation

**Approach:** Only confirms the signup. No brand building, no selling, no personality.

```
You're signed up for G's Cleaning product updates.

We'll email you when we have something new.

— G's Cleaning
```

---

## Variant 2: Immediate Utility

**Approach:** Give them something useful right now. The email earns its existence by providing value.

```
You're on the list.

Here's something most people don't know: all-purpose cleaners work better if you let them sit for 30 seconds before wiping. The surfactants need time to break down grease.

Try it on your stovetop.

## Variant 3: Expectation Setting

**Approach:** Tell them exactly what they'll receive and when. Reduce uncertainty.

```
You signed up for G's Cleaning updates.

Here's what that means:
- New product announcements (maybe 2-3 per year)
- Restock alerts if something sells out
- Occasional cleaning tips

That's it. No daily emails. No spam.

## Variant 4: Single Action

**Approach:** The entire email exists to get them to do ONE thing.

```
You're signed up.

One thing: if you haven't tried the All-Purpose yet, it's $12 and it works on basically everything.

## Variant 5: Product Education

**Approach:** Teach them something they didn't know about the product category.

```
Thanks for signing up.

Quick thing about cleaning products: most of them are 90% water. You're paying for packaging and shipping weight.

Ours are concentrated. One bottle makes four. Same clean, less plastic, less money.

That's the idea behind G's.

## Variant 6: Origin Story

**Approach:** Explain why this company exists. Connect the signup to something larger.

```
You signed up. Here's why we exist.

We started G's because we couldn't find cleaning products that actually smelled good and didn't cost $30 a bottle.

So we made them. Simple scents. Fair prices. Stuff that works.

That's it. Welcome.

## Variant 7: Problem Naming

**Approach:** Articulate the problem they have. Make them feel understood.

```
You signed up for updates.

If you're here, you've probably noticed: most cleaning products either smell like a chemical lab or cost way too much for what they are.

We're trying to fix that.

More soon.

G's Cleaning
```

---

## Variant 8: Future Promise

**Approach:** Tease what's coming. Create anticipation without delivering now.

```
You're in.

We're working on something new for kitchens. Can't say much yet, but you'll be the first to know.

Until then — thanks for signing up.

## Variant 9: Community Entry

**Approach:** Position this as joining something, not subscribing to something.

```
You're in.

G's started as a small thing in Brooklyn. Now there's a few thousand of us who care about this stuff — good scents, fair prices, less waste.

Glad you're here.

## Variant 10: Minimal Presence

**Approach:** Almost nothing. Just acknowledge. Trust that less is more.

```
Got it. You're on the list.

## Your Pick

Which one (if any) feels like it was written by a human who understands the product and the reader?

Which ones are obviously AI garbage despite the different approach?

What's missing from all of them?
